## Description

This repository contains the scripts used to develop the speaker-independent Speech Inversion system to estimate velar pharyngeal constriction degree tract variable. The work is based on the paper ["Speaker-independent Speech Inversion for Estimation of Nasalance
"](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2023/siriwardena23b_interspeech.html)

## Future Developments

This repository will be extended to create a tool that could be directly used to estimate the velar TV for a given speech audio(.wav). The tool will be added in the near future.
